      <h1>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h1>
      <p>Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
        The two most common display values are block and inline.</p>

        <h1>HTML Block Elements</h1>

        <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
        A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
        Two commonly used block elements are the "p" and "div" tags.

        <h1>HTML Inline Elements</h1>

        An inline element does not start on a new line.

        An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
